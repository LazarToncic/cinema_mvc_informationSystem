# cinema_mvc_informationSystem
This project is about movie reservation system, but not a usual one since you have Cart in which you can add more diffrent movies and quantities of movies which
will go into `reservation` table and `reservation_item` table from which we take information and show it with chartJS.There are alse roles and depending on the
role user will have access to diffrent views and methods, ability to add movies or just see what moviea are avalible to add to cart. Users with role 'Admin'
can change movies alredy in database or delete them, there is also a rewarding since for users who spent specified amount and will have prizes. Each movie
has its directors and actors with their respected roles. In statistics 1. chart shows us information about users who spent more money on what day, there 
are inputs which with help of jQuery and event listener change request will always be sent and we will get diffrent results like all inputs on this page,
2. chart shows top 10 users who spent largest amount of money in the last 3 months and 3. chart shows quantity of each movie sold.
